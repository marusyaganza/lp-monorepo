# SelectDefGame

**SelectDefGame** invites learners to choose the correct definition for a given word from several options.  
This interactive component is ideal for reinforcing vocabulary and checking semantic understanding in language-learning apps.

---

## How It Works

- The game displays a **task prompt** (for example: “Pick the correct definition”).
- The target **word** or phrase appears at the top, often with an **audio button** for pronunciation practice.
- Below, several definitions are presented as **selectable options**.
- The learner clicks to select the definition they think is correct.
- Pressing **Check** submits the answer; learners immediately receive feedback:
    - If the answer is correct, positive feedback and a **Continue** button appear.
    - If incorrect, the correct definition is revealed for review.
- Components are fully keyboard-accessible and visually styled for feedback and focus.
