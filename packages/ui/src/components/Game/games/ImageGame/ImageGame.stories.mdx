# ImageGame

**ImageGame** is an interactive language-learning component where learners view an image, then type a word or phrase matching the prompt.  
It’s ideal for visual vocabulary training, quick recall, and associating words with real-life images.

---

## How It Works

- The game shows an image and a prompt (for example: "Type the name of the object shown in the picture").
- The learner studies the image, types their answer in the input box, and presses **Check**.
    - If the answer is incorrect, the correct response is revealed.
    - If correct, the interface advances to the next question with **Continue**.
- Optional audio playback can support listening practice or pronunciation reinforcement.
- The input and buttons adapt based on current state: initial, error (incorrect), or success (correct).

## Features

- **Visual prompt:** A clear image helps learners directly associate meaning with vocabulary.
- **Text input:** Immediate typing and checking for fast feedback.
- **Correct answer reveal:** Instantly displays the right solution after an error.
- **Audio button:** Play pronunciation or related sound when available.
- **Smooth progression:** Easy next-question workflow for continuous practice.

## Typical User Flow

1. Read the prompt and observe the picture.
2. Type your answer.
3. Press **Check**.
4. Review feedback and correct answer (if wrong).
5. Click **Continue** to move to the next image.
