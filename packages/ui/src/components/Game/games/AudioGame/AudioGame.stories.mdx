# AudioGame

**AudioGame** is an interactive language-learning component where users listen to a word and type what they hear.  
It enhances listening comprehension and spelling practice, making vocabulary learning engaging and effective.

---

## How It Works

- The game presents an audio prompt:  
  _"Type the word that you've heard"_
- The user clicks the play button to listen to a word or phrase.
- After listening, the user types their answer into the input field provided.
- Pressing **Check** evaluates the answer and triggers instant feedback.
    - If the answer is correct, the game transitions to allow the user to **Continue**.
    - If incorrect, the correct answers are revealed for learning reinforcement.
- The interface is clean, focused, and supports keyboard navigation for accessibility.

---

## Key Features

- **Audio Playback:** Accessible play button lets users listen to the word as many times as needed.
- **Input Validation:** Immediate feedback with the correct answer displayed after an incorrect attempt.
- **Progression:** A simple workflow: listen → type → check answer → continue.
- **Refined Feedback:** Highlights mistakes and celebrates correct answers to reinforce learning.
- **Accessible:** Focusable inputs and buttons make the game usable for all learners.

## Typical User Flow

2. Type the word you hear into the input box.
3. Click **Check** to see if your answer is correct.
