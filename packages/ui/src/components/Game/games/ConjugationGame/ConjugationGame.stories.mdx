# ConjugationGame

The **ConjugationGame** component challenges users to fill in the conjugated forms of a verb for multiple pronouns.  
It’s tailored for Spanish verb practice, offering instant feedback and an immersive way to master conjugations through active recall.

---

## How It Works

- The game prompts the learner with a verb and a task, such as:  
  _"Fill in the forms of ‘tener’ in the present indicative"_
- Learners see a column of input fields, each labeled for a pronoun (yo, tú, él/ella, etc).
- Pressing the audio button plays the target verb’s pronunciation.
- After filling the answers, the user clicks **Check** to submit.
    - If answers are incorrect, the correct forms are displayed for review (see image: incorrect values are highlighted).
    - If all answers are correct, the user clicks **Continue** to proceed.
- Empty, hyphen (“-”), or disabled fields handle special forms, impersonal verbs, or irregularities.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Pronouns:** Presents inputs for all persons required by the verb.
- **Feedback:** Shows immediate validation after checking—errors and correct answers highlighted.
- **Audio Support:** Built-in audio playback helps reinforce the correct forms.
- **Adaptive Inputs:** Supports verbs where some forms are missing (with a dash).
- **Workflow:** Encourages try–check–correct–continue learning.
