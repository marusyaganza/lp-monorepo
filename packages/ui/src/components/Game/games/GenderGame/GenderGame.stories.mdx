# GenderGame

**GenderGame** is an interactive language-learning component designed to practice the grammatical gender of nouns (masculine or feminine).  
It’s ideal for learners developing their intuition and accuracy with gender assignment in Spanish vocabulary.

## How It Works

- The game presents a word (sometimes with audio).
- The user is prompted:  
  *Pick the correct gender*
- Two options—Feminine and Masculine—are shown as stylish buttons, each accompanied by an icon for quick visual recognition.
- Clicking an option selects the gender(s) the learner believes are correct.
- Press **Check** to submit and receive immediate feedback:
    - Correct choices highlight, incorrect choices indicate mistakes.
    - After an incorrect attempt, the correct answer is revealed.
    - If correct, **Continue** advances to the next word.

## Features

- **Audio Support:** If the word has pronunciation audio, a play button lets learners hear it before answering.
- **Visual Feedback:** Buttons and icons change styles to indicate correct, incorrect, or disabled states after submission.
- **Multiple Answers:** Support for words that can be both genders (where applicable).
- **Clear Progression:** Simple workflow—select gender, check answer, continue.
- **Accessible UI:** Focusable buttons and icon labels ensure usability for all learners.
