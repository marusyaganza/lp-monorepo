# SpeechInput

The **SpeechInput** component lets users practice pronunciation in the Speaking game.  
It uses the browser's Speech Recognition API to listen for spoken words, compare them to expected results, and provide instant feedback on accuracy and errors.

## Component Highlights

- **Purpose:** Helps users improve their pronunciation by speaking words or phrases directly into the app.
- **Interactive:** Users click the microphone button and say the word matching a description.
- **Feedback:** Shows listening state, detects unsupported browsers, displays recognition errors, and indicates pronunciation accuracy as a percentage.
- **Accessibility:** Can be triggered and controlled by keyboard, shows clear error messages and status updates.

## How It Works

- Click the microphone to start listening.
- Speak the word that matches the definition provided.  
  _Example prompt (as in the image):_  
  > "an official order given by a court that demands that something must or must not be done"

- Recognition will:
  - Capture your spoken word
  - Show accuracy percentage after listening
  - Give error feedback if not recognized or API is unsupported

- The component is designed to be used in pronunciation practice games, quizzes, or learning modules.
